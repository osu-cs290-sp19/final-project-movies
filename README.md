PLAN
 - what we need
  1. index.html
  2. style.css
  3. index.js
  4. possibly *server.js
  
 - our general outline
  1. a site to help keep track of what movies you want to see.
  2. each movie has a 
    a. name
    b. release date
    c. summary
    d. list of starring actors/actresses
  3. they are each articles.. much like twits.  that way they can be easily manipulated with style.css
  4. you can add your own movies
  5. when you click on an actors name.. it should link to a google search of their name
    a. this should come up with their profile.. cause it's all famous people
  6. when you add a movie required fields are
    a. name
    b. release date
  7. perhaps we could have a list of upcoming movies on the right of the screen? 
   a. like a lil calendar...

 - grading criteria (taken directly from final project description document)
  a. 50 points – Your app satisfies these requirements:
        - The app uses HTML and CSS to implement a well-designed client interface.
        - The app uses client-side JS to enable relevant user interactions.
        - The app is served using a Node.js-based (or other approved) serving stack.
        - The app dynamically generates pages based on data stored on the back end.
        - The app’s client interface communicates with the app’s server to create, read, update, and/or delete content in the back end data store.
  b. 25 points – Your app has a high-quality design and implementation.
        - For example, your app is free of bugs and has an effective user interface.
  c. 25 points – Your app is creative and original.
        - If, for example, your app is simply a repackaging of the app we develop together during lecture or the one you developed during your assignments this term, you will likely not score highly in this category.
